Through my work, I came across literature on &amp;ldquo;robustness&amp;rdquo;, the science of helping machine learning systems to avoid their natural tendency to be lazy learners. Sometimes, models will learn to focus on whatever pattern is easiest to pick out, regardless of whether the pattern actually corresponds to the informative features us humans use to make decisions.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://www.dhpitt.com/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 12:17:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhpitt.com/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a machine learning developer with a focus on reliable uncertainty estimation. I&amp;rsquo;m between jobs right now, but in the past I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on computer vision research problems at startups like Groundlight AI and Nanotronics Imaging.
In my free time, I&amp;rsquo;m working on research in &amp;ldquo;robustness&amp;rdquo;, the science of helping machine learning systems to avoid their natural tendency to be lazy learners. Sometimes, models will learn to focus on whatever pattern is easiest to pick out, regardless of whether the pattern actually corresponds to the informative features us humans use to make decisions.</description></item><item><title>Post1</title><link>https://www.dhpitt.com/blog/post1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 12:17:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhpitt.com/blog/post1/</guid><description>This is some markdown!</description></item><item><title>Resume</title><link>https://www.dhpitt.com/resume/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 12:17:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhpitt.com/resume/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
