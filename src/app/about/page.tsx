        <p>
          I like to be outside in the sun and in the water. I'm happiest
          when I'm doing one of those two every day. I like to move around and I tend to
          be really into a physical hobby. Which one varies; in the past it's been hiking,
          sport climbing, running, or my current top choice, surfing. I also love to bike, but
          in more of a "going around town" kinda way than a "spandex outfit" kinda way.

        <p>
          For work, I do machine learning development and research. I've worked on a few different
          domains, from scientific computing to machine vision, and soon robotics. I'm drawn to ML 
          because I believe that it's our job to make the physical production of Stuff as efficient
          as we can. Hopefully this will eventually mean everyone gets more of all the Stuff we need,
          like food, medicine and houses.

        <p>
          I'm happiest when I'm part of a big happy community. I like to make new friends
          and especially enjoy bringing people together over a delicious meal. Once I land
          permanently in New York in July, my first order of business will be finding a big 
          dinner table.
