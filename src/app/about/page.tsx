      <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading sm:text-2xl">Work</h2>
        <p>
          I work on ML and roboticsg at 
          <a href="https://www.ultra.tech/"> Ultra</a>, a startup deploying industrial robots. I just finished up
          two years at the AI4Science Lab at Caltech, where I worked on 
          <a href="https://neuraloperator.github.io/dev/index.html"> NeuralOperator</a>, a popular
          open-source library for PDE operator learning in PyTorch. 
          <br/>

          I'm drawn to ML because I believe that automation will be a huge step towards boosting our 
          capacity to produce and distribute all the things people need to live good lives, like
          food, houses and medicine.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading sm:text-2xl">Life in general</h2>

        <p>
          I like to be outside in the sun and in the water. I'm happiest
          when I'm doing one of those two every day. I like to move around and I tend to
          be really into a physical hobby. Which one varies; in the past it's been hiking,
          sport climbing, running, or my current top choice, surfing. I also love to bike, but
          in more of a "going around town" kinda way than a "spandex outfit" kinda way.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-heading sm:text-2xl">Social stuff</h2>
        <p>
          I'm happiest when I'm part of a big social community. I like to make new friends
          and especially enjoy bringing people together over a delicious meal. As part of my recent
          move to New York, my goal is to have as many people over for dinner as possible.
