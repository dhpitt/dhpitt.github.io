Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m working on improving the modularity and usability of neuraloperator, an open-source software library that allows users to implement the lab&amp;rsquo;s Neural Operator family of machine learning models on physical data governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are traditionally solved by methods that model equations as a discrete mesh over a surface.</description></item><item><title>InBrief - using AI to summarize environmental impact statements</title><link>https://www.dhpitt.com/work/inbrief/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 11:57:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.dhpitt.com/work/inbrief/</guid><description>In affiliation with the University of Michigan, Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning As part of Taubman College&amp;rsquo;s urban technology prototype grant program, I&amp;rsquo;m building a system that uses new large language modeling (LLM) technology to summarize the lengthy environmental impact analyses (EIAs) required of most urban development projects. In the half century since the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), these documents have stretched from an average length of 10 pages to over 1,600 pages.</description></item></channel></rss>
