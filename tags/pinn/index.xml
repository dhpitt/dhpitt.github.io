Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m working on improving the modularity and usability of neuraloperator, an open-source software library that allows users to implement the lab&amp;rsquo;s Neural Operator family of machine learning models on physical data governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs are traditionally solved by methods that model equations as a discrete mesh over a surface.</description></item></channel></rss>
